# Given two words (begin_word and end_word),
# and a dictionary's word list, return the shortest transformation
# sequence from begin_word to end_word, such that:
​
# Only one letter can be changed at a time.
# Each transformed word must exist in the word list.
# Note that begin_word is not a transformed word.
# Note:
​
# Return None if there is no such transformation sequence.
# All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
# You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
# You may assume begin_word and end_word are non-empty and are not the same.
# Sample:
# begin_word = "hit"
# end_word = "cog"
# return: ['hit', 'hot', 'cot', 'cog']
​
# begin_word = "sail"
# end_word = "boat"
# ['sail', 'bail', 'boil', 'boll', 'bolt', 'boat']
​
# beginWord = "hungry"
# endWord = "happy"
# None
